## Unsolved Problems / Known Issues
- Currently, some CRUD functionality requires a page refresh to render the changes in the browser.
- Users can create an account, but the User model is currently not related in any way to the other models.
- I was not able to figure out image upload.
- I am still working on making a bookmarklet so that users can save images from around the web.
